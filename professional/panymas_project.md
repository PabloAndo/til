Things to consider working in a NETIP PROJECT:

- Every file must be on the root, including pictures, styles, scripts, etc.
- Don't use pre-compilers such as SASS.
- In Javascript files:
  - Use ES5 functionalities or older versions.
  - Don't use let or const, just var
  - jQuery can be used but pay attention to variable declaration and methods. Check a github project to copy the methods and variable declarations.
  - netiP changes the name of the files and some texts. Use a hardcoded javascript object to pass resources to HTML elements.
- HTML must be 90 degrees rotated. Check github project to copy.
- The simplest, the best.
